## 📌 Overview
This is my **first mobile application** developed using **React Native**.  
It helps users **add goals, mark them as completed, and delete them easily**.

## ✨ Features
- ➕ Add new goals  
- 📜 Display goals in a dynamic scrollable list  
- ✅ **Single tap** → Mark goal as *completed* (strike-through)  
- ❌ **Long press** → Delete a goal  
- 🎨 Clean, modern UI with **dark theme & gradients**  
- 📱 Responsive for **Android & iOS**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React Native**
- **StyleSheet** for styling
- **Touchable events** (`onPress`, `onLongPress`) for interactions

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Enter a goal in the input field.
2. Tap **"Add Goal"** → Goal gets added to the list.
3. **Single tap** → Goal is marked as completed.
4. **Long press** → Goal is deleted from the list.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
